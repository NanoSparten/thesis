  abstract = {Texture is one of the important characteristics used in
  identifying objects or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a
  photomicrograph, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image. This paper
  describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial
  dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification
  tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds
  of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use
  categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial
  imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision
  rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise
  linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular
  parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was
  divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification
  accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial
  photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results
  indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general
  applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

  abstract = {Presents a
  theoretically very simple, yet efficient, multiresolution approach to
  gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local binary
  patterns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype
  distributions. The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary
  patterns, termed "uniform," are fundamental properties of local image texture
  and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture
  feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator
  presentation that allows for detecting the "uniform" patterns for any
  quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents
  a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The
  proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the
  operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of
  the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator
  can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup
  table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be
  achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local
  binary patterns.},

  title    = {Local, semi-local and global models for texture, object and scene
  recognition},
  abstract = {This dissertation addresses the problems of
  recognizing textures, objects, and scenes in photographs. We present
  approaches to these recognition tasks that combine salient local image
  features with spatial relations and effective discriminative learning
  techniques. First, we introduce a bag of features image model for recognizing
  textured surfaces under a wide range of transformations, including viewpoint
  changes and non-rigid deformations. We present results of a large-scale
  comparative evaluation indicating that bags of features can be effective not
  only for texture, but also for object categorization, even in the presence of
  substantial clutter and intra-class variation. We also show how to augment the
  purely local image representation with statistical co-occurrence relations
  between pairs of nearby features, and develop a learning and classification
  framework for the task of classifying individual features in a multi-texture
  image. Next, we present a more structured alternative to bags of features for
  object recognition, namely, an image representation based on semi-local parts,
  or groups of features characterized by stable appearance and geometric layout.
  Semi-local parts are automatically learned from small sets of unsegmented,
  cluttered images. Finally, we present a global method for recognizing scene
  categories that works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine
  sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each
  sub-region. The resulting spatial pyramid representation demonstrates
  significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization
  tasks.},

  abstract  = {A main
  challenge for texture analysis is to construct a compact texture descriptor
  which is not only highly discriminative to intra-class textures, but also
  robust to inter-class variations, geometric and photometric changes. In this
  paper, a new texture descriptor is developed by integrating the local
  affine-invariant texture features and the global viewpoint-invariant
  statistics. Based on the pixel clustering using two state-of-art robust local
  texture descriptors (i.e. SIFT and SPIN), the proposed texture descriptor
  enables impressive invariance to a wide range of environmental changes (e.g.
  view changes, illumination changes, surface distortions) by characterizing the
  spatial distribution of pixel sets using multi-fractal analysis. Experiments
  on some real datasets (publicly available) showed that the proposed texture
  descriptor achieved better performance than some state-of-art techniques in
  texture retrieval and texture classification while the computation cost is
  significantly reduced.},
